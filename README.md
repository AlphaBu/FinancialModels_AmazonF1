# Monte Carlo financial models on Amazon F1 instances
## Introduction
This repository includes F1-optimized implementations of four Monte Carlo financial models, namely:
  - the European and the Asian options of the the [Black-Scholes model](https://github.com/KitAway/BlackScholes_MonteCarlo), 
  - the European and the European barrier options the [Heston model](https://github.com/KitAway/HestonModel_MonteCarlo). 

(see the hyperlinks above for the mathematical theory behind them).

## Usage

### Black-Scholes kernel models

Examples of usage for the European and Asian options:

> blackEuro -s 100 -k 105 -r 0.1 -v 0.15 -t 10

> blackAsian -s 90 -k 110 -r 0.2 -v 0.1 -t 20

The outputs of both commands are the expected call and put prices.

Argument |  Meaning and default value
:-------- | :---
-t       |  time period (1.0)
-r       |  interest rate of riskless asset (0.05)
-v 	 |  volatility of the risky asset (0.2)
-s	 |  initial price of the stock (100)
-k       |  strike price for the option (110)

Note: some of the simulation parameters, namely the number of random number generators, the number of simulations running in parallel for a given RNG and the number of time steps, are set, for the sake of efficiency, as compile-time constants in **blackScholes.cpp**. 

Parameter |  information
:-------- | :---
NUM_STEPS    | number of time steps
NUM_RNGS | number of RNGs running in parallel, proportional to the area cost
NUM_SIMS   | number of simulations running in parallel for a given RNG (512 ensures a good BRAM usage)

### Heston kernel models

Examples of usage for European and European with barrier options:

> hestonEuro -s 256

> hestonEuroBarrier -s 512

The outputs of both commands are the expected call and put prices.

Argument |  Meaning and default value
:-------- | :---
-s       | number of simulation runs N (512)

Note: some of the simulation parameters, namely the number of random number generators and the number of time steps, are set, for the sake of efficiency, as compile-time constants in **heston.cpp**. 

Parameter |  information
:-------- | :---
NUM_STEPS    | number of time steps
NUM_RNGS | number of RNGs running in parallel, proportional to the area cost
